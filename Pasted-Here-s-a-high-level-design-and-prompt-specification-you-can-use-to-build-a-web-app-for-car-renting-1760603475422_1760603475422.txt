Here’s a high‑level design and prompt/specification you can use to build a **web app for car renting** with the features you asked for (payment, user profile, reviews, document verification, real‑time photo upload, etc.). You can give this to your development team (frontend + backend), or use it as a blueprint.

## 2. Sample Prompt / Spec to Give to a Developer Team

Here is a more narrative prompt/spec you can hand over:

> We want a **web application** for a car‐rental marketplace system. There will be two (or three) user roles: **User (renter)**, **Owner (who lists cars)**, and **Admin**.
>
> ### User Flow (Renter)
>
> 1. User registers with email & password, enters personal info, uploads government ID, and also uploads a real‑time selfie (live photo). The system should verify ID + selfie via a verification API.
> 2. Once verified, the user can browse available cars. They can filter by location, price, car type, features.
> 3. User picks a car, specifies rental period (start date/time, end date/time) and pick‑up / drop‑off location.
> 4. Price is calculated (base rate + extras). User is taken to a payment page where they can pay online (cards, UPI, wallets, etc.). Optionally pay a deposit.
> 5. After payment, the booking is recorded. The owner is notified and can accept or reject (or automatic acceptance if all conditions met).
> 6. Before pickup, user must upload photos of the car (damage / condition) and confirm start. After return, user uploads final photos and reports odometer / fuel.
> 7. After the trip, user can leave a review & rating for the car and for the owner. Owner may also leave review for the user.
>
> ### Owner / Car Lister Flow
>
> 1. Owner registers (similarly with verification) and gets a profile.
> 2. Owner can add multiple cars with full details (make, model, year, features, images), set pricing, availability calendar, and location.
> 3. Owner receives booking requests, can accept/reject, see upcoming bookings.
> 4. Owner sees earnings, pending payouts, history of bookings.
>
> ### Admin / Platform
>
> * Manage users (approve / reject verification)
> * Manage owners, cars, bookings
> * View analytics / reports (revenue, bookings, top cars)
> * Manage commissions, fees, cancellation policies
> * Moderate reviews, handle disputes
>
> ### Technical & Nonfunctional Requirements
>
> * Use REST API or GraphQL backend
> * Frontend should be responsive (desktop + mobile)
> * Secure user authentication (JWT, OAuth)
> * Use a document verification service (Onfido, Veriff, etc.)
> * Payment gateway integration (Stripe, Razorpay, etc.)
> * Store photos/files securely (cloud storage)
> * Logging, error handling, audit trails
> * Notifications (email, SMS, push)
> * Role‑based access control
>
> Please include UI wireframes / mockups for key pages (registration, catalog, booking, payment, profile, admin dashboard).

## 3. Example Page Flow (Wireframe Outline)

Here’s a rough page list / flow:

1. Landing / Home page
2. Sign up / Login
3. Verification page (upload ID + selfie)
4. User dashboard / profile
5. Car catalog / search results
6. Car detail page
7. Booking page (select date/time, pick‑up, drop)
8. Payment page
9. Booking confirmation / status page
10. Rental in progress page (upload photos, live status)
11. After return page (final photos, metadata)
12. Review & rating page
13. Owner panel: add car, manage listings, accept bookings, earnings
14. Admin panel: user management, cars, bookings, reports

## 4. Further Enhancements / “More Features” Ideas

* Dynamic pricing (peak vs off‑peak)
* Promo codes, discounts, loyalty rewards
* Insurance add-ons
* GPS / map integration (track car, route history)
* Chat / in‑app messaging between user & owner
* Multi‑city / location support
* Cancellation policies, refund logic
* Offline mode / caching
* Multi‑language, multi-currency support
* Real‑time availability updates & locking mechanism
* Damage deposit hold & release logic
* Push notifications & reminders

If you like, I can prepare a **full technical spec / UML diagrams / database schema** for this, or generate **frontend + backend scaffold code (e.g. in Node.js + React)** for you. Which one would you like me to do next?
